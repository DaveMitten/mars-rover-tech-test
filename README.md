# How to run the project

1. Clone the repo
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm start` to get the app front end up and running but not necessary.

# How to run the tests

1. Run `npm test`, this should show all the mars rover tests passing.

There is a front end to this, but its not complete and only done as a bit of fun. The tests show the tech test as complete and satisfied.

Any issues drop me an email.

Thanks!

Dave
